Adaptive recommendation engine based on past performance

Focused topic mode (e.g., "only DP this week")

Difficulty calibration (Easy, Medium, Hard)

3. 📚 AI Tutor & Code Feedback
GPT-powered line-by-line code review

“What if” scenarios to improve understanding

Suggests alternate solutions (e.g., iterative vs recursive)

Hints with increasing levels of detail

4. 📝 Practice Modes
🕒 Timed Mode: Simulate interviews

💭 Coaching Mode: Hints + step-by-step assistance

🔁 Retry Mode: Revisit failed problems after a delay

5. 🔍 Deep Problem Analytics
Tracks attempts, accuracy, and time per problem

Shows problem patterns (e.g., often fail binary search edge cases)

Highlights blind spots with recommended reading

6. 💬 Chat-Based Coaching
Natural chat interface (like ChatGPT)

Ask for help: “Explain my bug,” “Why is this O(n^2)?”

Conversational debugging assistant

7. 🛠️ Integration with LeetCode API
Sync problems, submissions, and history

Import completed problems automatically

One-click redirect to LeetCode to solve
