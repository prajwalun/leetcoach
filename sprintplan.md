## ‚è∞ Timeline (One-Day Hourly Breakdown)

| Time Slot     | Focus Area                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 9:00‚Äì9:30 AM  | Repo setup + DB schema          |
| 9:30‚Äì10:30 AM | Auth + user model               |
| 10:30‚Äì12:00PM | Frontend: dashboard + problem UI|
| 12:00‚Äì1:00 PM | Backend: problem + attempt APIs |

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done (DoD)

- User can sign up and log in  
- See a recommended problem (hardcoded or seeded)  
- Submit a solution (mocked or actual run)  
- Get GPT-generated feedback and store the attempt  
- See solved count and current streak on dashboard  

---

## üö® Risk Areas

- OpenAI API response delay or rate limits  
- LeetCode API limitations (use static JSON fallback)  
- Auth integration time (skip custom logic if blocked)

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

- [x] GitHub repo with fullstack code  
- [x] Working web app deployed on Vercel/Railway  
- [x] `README.md` with install/run instructions  
- [x] `DATA_MODEL.md` and `SPRINT_PLAN.md`
